Way more information over at [http://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/sampleapps](http://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/sampleapps)

**Bucket List:** One hundred things to do before you kick the bucket. A relatively basic 
list based application which illustrates the usage of the multi select
handler. Moreover the application loads and saves data from a JSON file.
_Use the multiSelectHandler in order to select several list entries at once. Add ActionSets and contextActions to a ListView. Load and save data from a JSON file._

**Cascades Cookbook:** The Cascades Cookbook shows you various controls and demonstrates their look and feel. 
This sample features two downloads: one written with QML and one with C++. 
Each individual "recipe" is designed for reuse should you want to use these in your own app.
_ActivityIndicator, Adding images, Animations, Buttons, CheckBox, Colors, DateTimePicker, DropDown, Labels, ListView, Layouts, Navigation, Ninesliced Images, ProgressIndicator, StockCurves, RadioGroup & RadioGroupOption, Slider, Text input_

**Cowbell:** A cow, a bell and Cascades are the only things you need to build a 
simple instrument app. In this sample, a rotation animation is used to 
animate a bell hanging around the neck of a cow.
_Handle rotation animations, Trigger C++ functions from QML, Use an AbsoluteLayout, Play a basic sound with OpenAL_

**Hello Cascades:** This is a very basic Hello World application for Cascades.
_Add an image to the UI, Add text to the UI, Use layouts in QML_

**HelloForeignWindow:** This is a an application that shows how to put a hole in a UI from Cascades to show your 
own content there.

**Kakel:** This is a puzzle game testing your logic skills. The game has some 
decorative and interaction elements set up in QML while the actual
game board and logic is handled in C++.  
_Load part of the UI in QML and part of it in C++, Dynamically change the part loaded in C++._

**Lightning Crossfade:**  Use a slider to crossfade between two images. 
_Add images to a UI, Use layouts with several UI elements, Add a slider and listen to slider events, Do all of the above in C++ & QML._

**PhotoBomber:** The PhotoBomber is a camera application that lets you take photos and then have them 
"bombed" by someone that jumps in automatically.
_Use the cascades multimedia library with Camera, Take a picture, Manipulate the image to be grayscale, Add a image over another image._

**PoemMaker:** The Poem Maker is a simple application with three lines of text (labels) 
and a button. Clicking the button will generate a random "refrigerator" poem.
_Add and position basic UI components (Label/Image), Attach an event listener that reacts to user interaction, Play animations, Use JavaScript functions in QML_

**PullMyBeard:** this sample application illustrates how to set up a very basic touch interaction. 
This is illustrated by moving an image in response to a touch event and 
animating it back to position when the touch ends.
_Move an image by touch (simple drag and drop), Trigger animations_

**Quotes:** Quotes is an application that shows you how to deal with dynamic data in
a list. It displays a list with some of our favorite sayings from clever
people when it comes to programming and technology. The list of quotes
is stored in an SQL database but you will also be able to add your own quotes and
delete the ones you don't agree with (or edit them to better fit your purpose).
_Set up a ListView with predefined item visuals, Load data with the SqlDataAccess, Sorting with the help of a GroupDataModel, Adding, updating and deleting items from a list._

**Speed Writer:** This is a challenging game for testing your typing skills on the virtual keyboard. 
Consequently, one of the things you learn with this sample is how to handle text input. 
The speed is measured using a gauge which is implemented as a Custom Control.
_Create a Custom Control in C++ and add it to a QML document, Monitor changes in a TextField and update a TextArea._

**StampCollector:** A philatelist collection of stamps is used to illustrate how to create a simple list 
and trigger changes in the UI on selection. List control signals are used to listen 
for item clicked events.
_Set up a ListView with customized item controls, Populate a List Control to a JSON and XML data model, Perform list selection event handling, Handle list item focus/unfocus events_

**Starship settings:** This sample shows a simple control panel for your average starship. You
will learn how to use the QSettings api for persistant storage of the
different settings.

**Weather Guesser:** Weather guessing has been a human activity that has gone on for
thousands of years. Nowadays there are even television programs
devoted to this phenomenon. The main objective of this app, apart
from producing more or less accurate weather forecasts is to
show how one goes about setting up an application using tabbed and
navigation panes. It also shows how to load data using both SQL
and nonlocal JSON feeds.
_How to use the NavigationPane and TabbedPane, How to populate a list using a GroupDataModel and JSON data, How to populate a list using a GroupDataModel and SQL, both asynchronously and synchronously._
